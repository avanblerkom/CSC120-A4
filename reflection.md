- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

Encapsulation makes sense to me logically. I like being able better organize my code with related attributes and methods within classes. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Start at the beginning by figuring out what needs to be public and what needs to be private. From there, encapsulation is a lot easier! Break it into small steps.
